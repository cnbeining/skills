# Reviewer Response Matrix

Copy this file and fill one row per **atomic** reviewer issue.

| ID | Reviewer | Quote / paraphrase | Type | Severity | Ask | Action (fix/clarify/constrain/rebut/defer) | Change location (file/section) | Evidence added (fig/table/analysis/cite) | Response text (draft) | Status |
|---:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | R1 | [TODO] | evaluation | must-fix | add baseline | fix | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | todo |

Notes:
- Keep “Response text” to 1–3 sentences; the full prose goes in `response_to_reviewers.md`.
- Prefer “fix” over “rebut” unless the paper already contains the evidence and signposting is the real issue.
